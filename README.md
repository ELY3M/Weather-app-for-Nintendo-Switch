# Weather app for Nintendo Switch



# BUG: The gps setting do not work right now.  Just have to set your GPS manually by make weather-gps.txt with your GPS like this 39.755,-93.103 in it. The weather-gps.txt just go in /switch/ folder.   




This weather homebrew app only get you weather info like Temp or Condition.  

you need to set your GPS in the setting by press - button.

Press A or X to get weather info.  

Press + to exit to homebrew menu.
